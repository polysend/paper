## Introduction

The emergence of blockchain technology and digital tokens has created new possibilities for online payments. Unlike traditional payment systems that rely on centralized intermediaries, token-based payments offer potential advantages in terms of speed, cost, and global accessibility. However, these benefits have remained largely theoretical for most internet users due to significant usability challenges.

Making a token payment typically requires multiple steps: maintaining a separate wallet application, copying addresses between applications, confirming transactions, and waiting for block confirmations. This process creates friction that discourages adoption and limits the potential of token-based payments.

Polysend was born from a simple question: What if making a token payment was as simple as clicking a button? By creating a browser extension that integrates directly with websites and handles the complexities of token transactions behind the scenes, we aim to make token payments accessible to everyone.

## The Current Payment Landscape

### Challenges with Traditional Payment Methods

Traditional online payment methods like credit cards and digital wallets have made significant strides in user experience, but continue to face several limitations:

1. **Geographic restrictions**: Many payment processors don't operate in all countries
2. **High fees**: Merchants often pay 2-3% in processing fees
3. **Chargebacks**: Merchants face the risk of fraudulent reversals
4. **Data privacy concerns**: Payment processors collect and monetize user data
5. **Settlement delays**: Funds can take days to reach merchants

### Limitations of Current Token Payment Solutions

Blockchain-based tokens address some of these challenges but introduce new ones:

1. **Technical complexity**: Users need to understand wallets, addresses, and gas fees
2. **Poor user experience**: Multiple steps required to complete a simple payment
3. **Fragmentation**: Different tokens require different wallets and procedures
4. **Integration difficulties**: Websites must implement complex integrations
5. **Security concerns**: Users face risks from phishing and user error

These limitations have prevented token payments from achieving mainstream adoption despite their theoretical advantages. A new approach is needed to bridge the gap between the potential of token payments and the reality of everyday online transactions.

## Polysend's Approach

Polysend reimagines the token payment experience from first principles, with a focus on simplicity, security, and seamless integration. Our approach centers on three key innovations:

### 1. Browser-Native Experience

By implementing Polysend as a browser extension, we create a payment layer that works naturally within users' existing browsing habits. There's no need to switch between applications or copy and paste addressesâ€”payments happen directly on the websites users already visit.

### 2. Multi-Token Support with Automatic Selection

Unlike most wallet solutions that focus on a single blockchain or token, Polysend supports multiple tokens and automatically selects the appropriate one based on the website's requirements. This eliminates the need for users to manage multiple wallets or manually select tokens for each transaction.

### 3. One-Click Payments

Polysend reduces the payment process to a single click, handling all the complexity behind the scenes. From wallet management to transaction confirmation, the technical details are abstracted away to provide a frictionless experience.

These innovations combine to create a payment solution that feels as natural and simple as traditional payment methods while leveraging the advantages of blockchain-based tokens.

## Technical Architecture

Polysend's technical architecture is designed to balance security, usability, and flexibility. While this paper focuses on non-technical aspects, understanding the basic architecture helps illustrate how Polysend achieves its goals.

### Browser Extension Components

The Polysend browser extension consists of several key components:

1. **Secure Wallet Management**: Handles the creation, encryption, and use of blockchain wallets
2. **Content Detection**: Identifies websites that support Polysend through meta tags
3. **Transaction Processing**: Manages the creation, signing, and submission of token transactions
4. **User Interface**: Provides a simple, intuitive interface for confirming and tracking payments
5. **Network Selection**: Allows users to choose between main, test, and development networks

### How Transactions Work

When a user clicks a payment button on a Polysend-enabled website, the following process occurs:

1. The extension detects the payment request and relevant details from the website's meta tags, including recipient address and token information
2. User is presented with a confirmation dialog showing payment details
3. Upon confirmation, the extension:
   - Retrieves the user's encrypted wallet
   - Constructs the appropriate transaction
   - Signs the transaction with the user's private key
   - Submits the transaction to the blockchain network
   - Returns a success confirmation to the user and website
4. The entire process typically completes in seconds, providing near-instant feedback to the user

### Token Management

Polysend works with multiple token types:

1. **Native blockchain tokens** (like SOL)
2. **Custom tokens** created on supported blockchains
3. **Program-specific tokens** that follow standard token interfaces

The extension automatically detects the required token from the website's meta tags and uses the appropriate methods to send that specific token type.

## Security and Privacy

Security is paramount in financial applications, and Polysend implements multiple layers of protection to safeguard user funds and data.

### Wallet Security

The core of Polysend's security model is its approach to wallet management:

1. **Client-Side Key Generation**: Private keys are generated locally within the browser, never transmitted to servers
2. **Strong Encryption**: Private keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a key derived using PBKDF2 with high iteration counts
3. **Multiple Security Layers**:
   - Extension-bound encryption that ties wallet security to the specific extension instance
   - Optional user password for additional security
   - Chrome's secure storage API for encrypted data
4. **No External Servers**: Polysend never sends private keys or unencrypted wallet data to any server

### Transaction Security

Every transaction undergoes multiple security checks:

1. **Visible Confirmation**: Users must explicitly confirm transaction details
2. **Amount Validation**: Checks to prevent sending more tokens than intended
3. **Recipient Verification**: Plans for recipient verification to reduce the risk of payments to incorrect or fraudulent addresses
4. **Network Confirmation**: Clear indication of which network (main, test, dev) is being used

### Privacy Considerations

Polysend is designed with user privacy in mind:

1. **Minimal Data Collection**: The extension collects only the data necessary for operation
2. **No Transaction Tracking**: Polysend doesn't track or store user transaction history on remote servers
3. **Encrypted Messaging**: Optional encrypted messages that accompany transactions can only be read by the recipient
4. **No KYC Requirements**: Users can generate and use wallets without providing personal information

### Independent Security Auditing

Prior to final release, Polysend will undergo:

1. **Code Audits**: Independent review of all security-critical code
2. **Penetration Testing**: Active attempts to identify vulnerabilities
3. **Open Source Review**: Community examination of code for potential issues

### Transparency Measures

To build trust and enable verification, Polysend implements several transparency measures:

1. **Open Source Code**: All Polysend code will be publicly available for review
2. **Detailed Documentation**: Clear explanations of security mechanisms
3. **Transaction Verification**: Ability to verify submitted transactions on block explorers
4. **No Hidden Fees**: All costs are clearly communicated to users

### Security Best Practices for Users

Polysend provides clear guidance to users on security best practices:

1. **Backing Up Wallet Information**: Processes for safely backing up wallet recovery information
2. **Recognizing Phishing Attempts**: Education on how to identify fraudulent websites

4. **Balance Management**: Recommendations to limit funds kept in browser-based wallets

By combining these security measures with an emphasis on transparency and education, Polysend creates a secure environment for token transactions without compromising on usability.

## User Experience

Polysend's design philosophy centers on creating a payment experience that feels natural and intuitive, even for users with no prior experience with blockchain tokens.

### Onboarding Flow

The extension onboarding process is designed to be as frictionless as possible:

1. **One-Click Installation**: Standard browser extension installation from the Chrome Web Store
2. **Instant Wallet Creation**: Automatic generation of a secure wallet upon first use
3. **No Registration Required**: No accounts, email addresses, or personal information needed
4. **Simple Configuration**: Minimal settings with smart defaults

### Payment Process

The core payment experience is streamlined to three simple steps:

1. **Discover**: User sees a "Pay with Polysend" button on websites that support it
2. **Confirm**: After clicking, user reviews and confirms payment details in a popup
3. **Complete**: User receives confirmation when the transaction completes

This process typically takes just seconds, making token payments as convenient as traditional payment methods.

### Visual Design

Polysend's visual design emphasizes clarity and confidence:

1. **Clean Interface**: Minimalist design that focuses on essential information
2. **Clear Confirmations**: Explicit display of payment details before confirmation
3. **Real-Time Feedback**: Visible transaction progress and confirmation
4. **Intuitive Controls**: Self-explanatory buttons and inputs

### Accessibility Considerations

Polysend is designed to be accessible to users of all abilities:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality available without a mouse
2. **Screen Reader Support**: Appropriate labels and ARIA attributes
3. **High Contrast Options**: Readability for users with visual impairments
4. **Language Support**: Interface translated into multiple languages

By focusing on these user experience elements, Polysend makes token payments accessible to a broad audience, regardless of their technical background or familiarity with blockchain concepts.

## Implementation for Websites

Integrating Polysend into a website is designed to be straightforward, requiring minimal technical expertise.

### Basic Integration

To accept payments via Polysend, a website simply needs to add meta tags to its HTML head:

```html
<!-- Required: Recipient's blockchain address -->
<meta name="polysend-recipient" content="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY">

<!-- Optional: Token specification (default is SOL) -->
<meta name="polysend-token" content='{
  "tokenMint": "TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS",
  "tokenSymbol": "TOKEN",
  "tokenDecimals": 9,
  "defaultAmount": 1
}'>
```

These tags provide the extension with the necessary information to process payments to the correct recipient using the appropriate token.

### Payment Button Implementation

Websites can implement payment buttons in two ways:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Polysend automatically adds a payment button to websites with the appropriate meta tags
2. **Custom Implementation**: Developers can create custom payment buttons that interact with the extension through a simple JavaScript API

### Callback Handling

For more advanced integrations, websites can implement callback handling:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('polysend-transaction', (event) => {
  const { status, signature, amount, token } = event.detail;
  if (status === 'success') {
    // Handle successful payment
    console.log(`Received ${amount} ${token} with signature ${signature}`);
  }
});
```

This enables websites to update their UI or perform additional actions in response to payment events.

### Design Guidelines

Polysend provides design guidelines to help websites create consistent, trusted payment experiences:

1. **Button Styling**: Recommended styles for payment buttons
2. **Language**: Suggested terminology for describing Polysend payments
3. **User Flow**: Best practices for integrating payments into the overall user journey

By making website integration as simple as possible, Polysend reduces the barriers to adoption for merchants and content creators.

## Recipient Verification Roadmap

One of the key challenges in any payment system is ensuring that funds are sent to the intended recipient. While Polysend already enables direct transactions to specified blockchain addresses, we recognize the need for stronger verification mechanisms to prevent fraud and build user confidence.

### Current Status

In the current implementation, website users must trust that the blockchain address specified in the meta tags belongs to the legitimate website owner. While this is adequate for many use cases, it does create potential risks:

1. **Compromised Websites**: If a website is hacked, the attacker could change the recipient address
2. **Phishing Sites**: Fraudulent websites could mimic legitimate ones to misdirect payments
3. **User Error**: Users may not verify the recipient details before confirming payments

### Verification Approaches Under Consideration

We are actively researching several approaches to recipient verification:

#### 1. DNS-Based Verification

This approach would link blockchain addresses to domain names using DNS TXT records:

- Website owners would add a specific TXT record to their domain's DNS settings
- The extension would verify that the address in the meta tag matches the one in the DNS record
- Benefits include leveraging existing DNS infrastructure and relative simplicity
- Challenges include potential DNS hijacking and administrative overhead for website owners

#### 2. Cryptographic Signature Verification

This method would use cryptographic signatures to prove address ownership:

- Website owners would sign a message using their blockchain private key
- The signature, along with the message, would be included in the website's meta tags
- The extension would verify the signature against the claimed recipient address
- Benefits include strong cryptographic security
- Challenges include signature rotation and complexity for non-technical users

#### 3. Centralized Verification Service

This approach would involve a trusted verification service:

- Website owners would register and verify their identity and blockchain address
- The service would issue verification tokens to confirmed websites
- The extension would check with the service before processing payments
- Benefits include potential for stronger identity verification
- Challenges include centralization and dependency on a third party

### Implementation Timeline

Our roadmap for recipient verification includes:

1. **Research Phase** (Current): Evaluating different approaches for security, usability, and implementation complexity
2. **Design Phase** (Upcoming): Developing detailed specifications for the selected approach
3. **Prototype Phase**: Implementing a test version for community feedback
4. **Launch Phase**: Releasing verification features to all users

We are committed to implementing robust verification mechanisms while maintaining the simplicity and ease of use that defines Polysend.
